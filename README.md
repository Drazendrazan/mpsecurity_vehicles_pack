This Vehicles Has been converted from mpsecurity update, for fivem only. 
as Rockstar has limited .ymt files free space, thats mean now on latest build 4525 we can only have one pack of clothing.

but on build 2372 we can have 2 packs of clothing. ( custom clothing ), but the new vehicles cant be loaded in game. 

i have made a solution to convert new update in fivem ready vehicle pack. 

drag and drop to resourceses and add in server.cfg file ensure [mpsecurity_vehicle_pack] or rename the folder and name whatever you wish.

builds information for custom clothing packs.
Lets take a look at how Rockstar Games takes up the free .ymt slots every update:

In game version b1604 (mpchristmas2018) we had 14 additional free .ymt slots to be used
In game version b1737 (mpvinewood) we had 12 additional free .ymt slots to be used
In game version b1868 (mpheist3) we had 10 additional free .ymt slots to be used
In game version b2060 (mpsum) we had 8 additional free .ymt slots to be used
In game version b2189 (mpheist4) we had 6 additional free .ymt slots to be used
In game version b2372 (mptuner) we had 4 additional free .ymt slots to be used
In current game version b2545 (mpsecurity) we have 2 additional free .ymt slots to be used
